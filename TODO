Future development ideas/TODOs

- Add load/performance testing functionality. Make it possible to parallelize execution of dhcptool
- Include a libnet version in distribution, as its hosting does not seem to be so stable (possibly also include libpcap)
- Add a listen-only mode?
- More verbosity levels, more consistent output at different levels
- more ideas...
- testing gitolite hooks2
